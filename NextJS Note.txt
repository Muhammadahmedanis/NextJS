NextJS provide 3 types of rendering
Clinet side 
Server side
Static Side Generation & ISR

in react 
babel compile code and convert into react.createElement(tomakeplainJS) then send to browser and browser create DOM element 

inn next
after convert into react.createElment then convert into html string then send html as html file
final jsx convert into and send from server not browser 

we cannot run browser code on server that why we use client 

consider example of window if use useClient frist run onserver and show error and then run on browser 

next js run react code on server and generate pure html and send 
but in normal react send empty html file and js come and create js html file and paint browser

React has static server as request come it will serve 
but next js hs dynamic server


working fir go root paage.js then layout.js and then other folder to page.js


RENDERING_PARADIAM
Where html of app can be generated?

Server: get html from server and render on browser  SSR
SSR has good SEO but not good response time

Client: like react work                             CSR
CSR has good response time but not good SEO becuse og empty html file

SSR has two types:
SSR: Server side Generation
ISR: Incremental Side regeneration

in NextJS jis page par ham honga page reload karinga us ka html load hoga and baqi ka RSC losd hoga in production and complete all paes ka data nhi aaiga jiska link visible honga us ka hi aaiga and then jase jase visible honga aata jaiga data in RSC

NextJS has a server side rendering
Server components execute only on server where as client componenets excute on server as well as client 
async await is not supported on client components only server

in production we use npm start > server.log 2>&1
if we restart server to remsin previous error in file we do npm start >> server.log 2>&1
