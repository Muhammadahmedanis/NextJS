NextJS provide 3 types of rendering
Clinet side 
Server side
Static Side Generation & ISR

in react 
babel compile code and convert into react.createElement(tomakeplainJS) then send to browser and browser create DOM element 

inn next
after convert into react.createElment then convert into html string then send html as html file
final jsx convert into and send from server not browser 

we cannot run browser code on server that why we use client 

consider example of window if use useClient frist run onserver and show error and then run on browser 

next js run react code on server and generate pure html and send 
but in normal react send empty html file and js come and create js html file and paint browser

React has static server as request come it will serve 
but next js hs dynamic server
